## üö® Anti-Circumvention Policies

### Automated Detection

#### Fork Monitoring
```yaml
GitHub Actions - Fork Monitor:
  name: üîç Fork Monitoring
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours
  
  checks:
    - Scan for forks with license verification removed
    - Check for modified premium feature imports
    - Detect repositories with similar names
    - Monitor for redistributed binaries
```

#### License Bypass Detection
```yaml
Pattern Detection:
  - Modified require_feature() calls
  - Commented out license checks
  - Hardcoded premium tier assignments
  - Removed license verification modules
  - Modified feature registry definitions

Automated Response:
  - Create GitHub issue for investigation
  - Notify legal team via email
  - Document violation for potential DMCA
```

### Legal Protection Framework

#### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
```yaml
CLA Requirements:
  - All contributors sign CLA before first contribution
  - Copyright assignment to Chess Vector organization
  - Automated CLA check via CLA Assistant
  - Block PRs without signed CLA

CLA Content:
  - Copyright assignment clause
  - Patent grant provision
  - Warranty disclaimers
  - Commercial use restrictions for premium features
```

#### DMCA Takedown Process
```yaml
Violation Response:
  1. Automated detection ‚Üí Investigation queue
  2. Manual verification ‚Üí Document evidence
  3. Cease and desist ‚Üí 7-day response period
  4. DMCA takedown ‚Üí GitHub/hosting providers
  5. Legal action ‚Üí If necessary for persistent violations

Documentation Required:
  - Screenshots of infringing repository
  - Diff analysis showing license removal
  - Evidence of commercial redistribution
  - Copyright ownership proof
```

### Technical Enforcement

#### Repository Scanning
```yaml
Weekly Security Scan:
  targets:
    - All public forks
    - Similar repository names
    - Packages on crates.io with similar functionality
  
  scan_for:
    - License verification bypass
    - Premium feature extraction
    - Modified copyright notices
    - Unauthorized binary distribution
```

#### Community Reporting
```yaml
Violation Reporting:
  - Email: legal@chessvector.ai
  - GitHub Issue Template: License Violation Report
  - Anonymous reporting form on website
  - Community reward program for valid reports

Response SLA:
  - Acknowledgment: 24 hours
  - Investigation: 72 hours
  - Action plan: 7 days
  - Resolution: 30 days
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Protection Strategies

### Short-term Improvements

#### Code Obfuscation
```rust
// Build script enhancement
fn main() {
    // Obfuscate premium feature identifiers
    if cfg!(feature = "premium") {
        obfuscate_premium_features();
    }
    
    // Generate runtime license checks
    generate_distributed_license_checks();
    
    // Embed build signature
    embed_tamper_detection();
}
```

#### License Server Integration
```yaml
Server-side Validation:
  - Cryptographic license verification
  - Hardware fingerprinting
  - Usage analytics and anomaly detection
  - Real-time license revocation
  - Geographic usage tracking

API Endpoints:
  - POST /api/v1/license/verify
  - POST /api/v1/license/activate  
  - GET /api/v1/license/status
  - POST /api/v1/license/heartbeat
```

### Medium-term Hardening

#### Binary Protection
```yaml
Protection Mechanisms:
  - Anti-debugging techniques
  - Control flow obfuscation
  - String encryption for license logic
  - Binary packing/encryption
  - Runtime integrity checks

Distribution:
  - Signed binaries with certificate validation
  - Encrypted premium modules
  - Server-side neural network weights
  - Just-in-time code generation
```

#### Network-dependent Features
```yaml
Cloud Components:
  - Premium algorithms run server-side
  - Encrypted communication channels
  - Progressive feature unlocking
  - Usage-based licensing validation
  - Real-time model updates
```

### Long-term Strategy

#### Separate Repository Structure
```yaml
Repository Architecture:
  chess-vector-engine-open/     # Public, open source only
  chess-vector-engine-premium/  # Private, premium features
  chess-vector-engine-build/    # Private, build orchestration
  chess-vector-licenses/        # Private, license management
  
Benefits:
  - Premium source never public
  - Controlled build process
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Easier to protect intellectual property
```

## üìã Monitoring and Compliance

#### Daily Checks
```yaml
Automated Tasks:
  - Fork analysis and scoring
  - Package registry monitoring
  - Social media mention scanning
  - Binary hash verification
  - License server health checks

Alerts:
  - High-risk fork detected
  - Unauthorized package publication
  - License server anomalies
  - Security vulnerability reports
  - Community violation reports
```

#### Monthly Reviews
```yaml
Compliance Review:
  - License violation investigation results
  - Legal action status updates
  - Protection mechanism effectiveness
  - Community feedback analysis
  - Financial impact assessment

Stakeholder Reports:
  - Management dashboard
  - Legal team briefings
  - Security team updates
  - Community manager reports
```

### Community Engagement

#### Education Campaign
```yaml
Community Education:
  - Clear licensing documentation
  - Value proposition explanation
  - Contribution guidelines
  - Commercial feature justification
  - Support sustainability messaging

Positive Reinforcement:
  - Contributor recognition program
  - Open source achievement badges
  - Premium feature trial programs
  - Educational content creation
  - Conference speaking opportunities
```
