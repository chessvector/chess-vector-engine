## 📦 Installation

### Cargo (Recommended)

```bash
cargo install chess-vector-engine

# Or add to your Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
chess-vector-engine = "0.4.0"
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chessvector/chess-vector-engine
cd chess-vector-engine
cargo build --release
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Basic Engine Usage

```rust
use chess_vector_engine::ChessVectorEngine;
use chess::Board;
use std::str::FromStr;

// Create engine with tactical search enabled by default (14-ply depth)
let mut engine = ChessVectorEngine::new(1024);

// All professional features included in open source:
// ✅ Advanced tactical search (14 ply + check extensions)
// ✅ Principal Variation Search with sophisticated pruning  
// ✅ Move recommendation with calibrated evaluation
// ✅ 1600-1800 ELO strength validated against Stockfish
// ✅ GPU acceleration, NNUE networks, memory-mapped loading

// Analyze positions with tournament-level strength
let board = Board::from_str("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1").unwrap();
let evaluation = engine.evaluate_position(&board);
let recommendations = engine.recommend_moves(&board, 5);

println!("Position evaluation: {:?}", evaluation);
println!("Best moves: {:?}", recommendations);
```

### Advanced Configuration Options

```rust
use chess_vector_engine::{ChessVectorEngine, tactical_search::TacticalConfig, strategic_evaluator::StrategicConfig};

// Default engine (14 ply depth + Strategic Initiative System)
let mut engine = ChessVectorEngine::new(1024);
let strategic_config = StrategicConfig::master_level(); // Validated 1600-1800 ELO
engine.enable_strategic_evaluation(strategic_config);

// Maximum strength for correspondence chess (18 ply + deep extensions)
let engine = ChessVectorEngine::new_strong(1024);

// Performance-critical applications (pattern recognition only)
let engine = ChessVectorEngine::new_lightweight(1024);

// Custom strategic configuration
let mut engine = ChessVectorEngine::new_lightweight(1024);
let strategic_config = StrategicConfig::aggressive(); // High initiative focus
engine.enable_strategic_evaluation(strategic_config);

// Auto-load training data with Strategic Initiative included
let engine = ChessVectorEngine::new_with_auto_load(1024)?;
```

### Tactical Search Configurations

| Configuration | Depth | Time Limit | Best For | Check Extensions |
|---------------|--------|------------|----------|------------------|
| `TacticalConfig::fast()` | 8 ply | 1s | Blitz games | ✅ Enabled |
| `TacticalConfig::default()` | **14 ply** | 8s | **Standard play** | ✅ **3-ply extensions** |
| `TacticalConfig::strong()` | 18 ply | 30s | Correspondence | ✅ Deep extensions |

```rust
// Blitz play (fast responses)
let blitz_config = TacticalConfig::fast();

// Default configuration (strong tactical play)
let default_config = TacticalConfig::default();  // Used automatically in new()

// Maximum strength (correspondence chess)
let strong_config = TacticalConfig::strong();   // Used in new_strong()

// Custom configuration
let custom_config = TacticalConfig {
    max_depth: 16,
    max_time_ms: 10000,
    enable_check_extensions: true,
    check_extension_depth: 4,
    ..TacticalConfig::default()
};
```

### ⚡ Performance Considerations

**Default Configuration Impact:**
- **Strong tactical play** enabled by default for tournament-level chess
- **14-ply search depth** provides excellent move quality but requires ~2-8 seconds per move
- **Check extensions** ensure forcing sequences are calculated accurately

**Performance Guidelines:**
```rust
// For real-time applications requiring <1s responses
let engine = ChessVectorEngine::new_lightweight(1024);
engine.enable_tactical_search(TacticalConfig::fast());

// For analysis where accuracy is more important than speed  
let engine = ChessVectorEngine::new_strong(1024);

// For background position evaluation
let engine = ChessVectorEngine::new_lightweight(1024);  // Pattern recognition only
```

**Typical Performance:**
- **Lightweight engine**: ~1ms evaluation (pattern recognition only)
- **Default engine**: ~2-8 seconds evaluation (14-ply tactical search)
- **Strong engine**: ~10-30 seconds evaluation (18-ply + deep extensions)

### UCI Engine

```bash
# Run as UCI engine for chess GUIs
cargo run --bin uci_engine

# Or use installed binary
chess-vector-engine-uci

# Compatible with Arena, ChessBase, Scid, and other UCI interfaces
```

## 🔧 Command Line Tools
